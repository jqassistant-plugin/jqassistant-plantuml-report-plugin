= jQAssistant PlantUML Report Plugin

This is the https://plantuml.com/[PlantUML^] report plugin for https://jqassistant.org[jQAssistant^].

It provides the capability to render diagrams from the results of concepts and constraints:

* `plantuml-component-diagram`
* `plantuml-class-diagram`
* `plantuml-sequence-diagram`

For more information on jQAssistant see https://jqassistant.org[^].

<1> Dependency to the PlantUML Report plugin


The plugin provides support for generating the following diagrams from rule results:

* <<ComponentDiagrams>>
* <<ClassDiagrams>>
* <<SequenceDiagrams>>

NOTE: This feature is based on http://plantuml.com/[PlantUML] which itself relies on http://www.graphviz.org[Graphviz].
The latter needs to be installed and the `dot` executable must be present on the system path.

[[ComponentDiagrams]]
=== Component Diagrams

To activate component diagram rendering the report type must be set to `plantuml-component-diagram`.
The result of the rule simply needs to return all required nodes and their relationships:

.jqassistant/index.adoc
....
[[DependencyDiagram]]
[source,cypher,role=concept,requiresConcepts="dependency:Package",reportType="plantuml-component-diagram"] // <1>
.Creates a diagram about dependencies between packages containing Java types (test artifacts are excluded).
----
MATCH
  (artifact:Main:Artifact)-[:CONTAINS]->(package:Package)-[:CONTAINS]->(:Type)
OPTIONAL MATCH
  (package)-[dependsOn:DEPENDS_ON]->(:Package)
RETURN
  package, dependsOn                                                                                           // <2>
----
....
<1> The report type is set to `plantuml-component-diagram`.
<2> The packages are returned as nodes and their dependencies (dependsOn) as relationships.

The result might also specify graph-alike structures which will be rendered as PlantUML folders.
The following example therefore uses a modified return clause:

.jqassistant/index.adoc
....
[[DependencyPerArtifactDiagram]]
[source,cypher,role=concept,requiresConcepts="dependency:Package",reportType="plantuml-component-diagram"]
.Creates a diagram about dependencies between packages containing Java types (per artifact, test artifacts are excluded).
----
MATCH
  (artifact:Main:Artifact)-[:CONTAINS]->(package:Package)-[:CONTAINS]->(:Type)
OPTIONAL MATCH
  (package)-[dependsOn:DEPENDS_ON]->(:Package)
RETURN
  {                                   // <1>
    role : "graph",                   // <2>
    parent : artifact,                // <3>
    nodes : collect(package),         // <4>
    relationships: collect(dependsOn) // <5>
  }
----
....
<1> Instead of nodes and relations a map-like structure is returned
<2> `role` determines that the map shall be interpreted as graph containing nodes and relationships
<3> `parent` specifies the node that shall be rendered as folder, i.e. the container of nodes
<4> `nodes` are the nodes to be included in the folder
<5> `relationships` are the relationships between the nodes, they may reference nodes of other parents/folders

[[ClassDiagrams]]
=== Class Diagrams

To activate class diagram rendering the report type must be set to `plantuml-class-diagram`.
The result may contain any of the following elements:

* Packages (`:Java:Package`)
* Types (`:Java:Type`)
* Members (`:Java:Member`, `:Java:Field`, `:Java:Method`)
* Inheritance relations between types (`:EXTENDS`, `:IMPLEMENTS`)
* any other type relations (rendered as associations)

.jqassistant/index.adoc
....
[[ClassDiagram]]
[source,cypher,role=concept,requiresConcepts="java:InnerType",reportType="plantuml-class-diagram"]
.Creates a class diagram.
----
MATCH
  (p:Package)-[:CONTAINS]->(t:Type)-[:DECLARES]->(m:Member) // <1>
WHERE NOT
  t:Inner
OPTIONAL MATCH
  (t)-[e:EXTENDS|IMPLEMENTS]->(:Type)                       // <2>
OPTIONAL MATCH
  (t)-[d:DEPENDS_ON]->(:Type)                               // <3>
RETURN
  *
----
....
<1> Matches Java packages, types and their declared members
<2> Optionally include super classes and implemented interfaces
<3> Optionally include any dependencies, rendered as associations

[[SequenceDiagrams]]
=== Sequence Diagrams

To activate sequence diagram rendering the report type must be set to `plantuml-sequence-diagram`.
The result of the rule must return a column `sequence` containing a path-structure:

.jqassistant/index.adoc
....
[[SequenceDiagram]]
[source,cypher,role=concept,reportType="plantuml-sequence-diagram"]
.Creates a sequence diagram.
----
MATCH
  (type:Type{name:"MyService"})-[:DECLARES]->(root:Method{signature:"void doSomething()"}),
  sequence=(root)-[:INVOKES*]->(:Method)
RETURN
  sequence // <1>
----
....
<1> The sequence to convert to a diagram

NOTE: The sequence diagram is sensitive to the order of participants and messages.
The diagram rendering algorithm therefore relies on a depth-first result structure as provided by the `path` function.
All elements are rendered in the order of their first occurrence.

If a path cannot be returned directly the result may provide the columns `participants` (nodes) and `messages` (relationships):

.jqassistant/index.adoc
....
[[SequenceDiagram]]
[source,cypher,role=concept,reportType="plantuml-sequence-diagram"]
.Creates a sequence diagram.
----
MATCH
  (type:Type{name:"MyService"})-[:DECLARES]->(root:Method{signature:"void doSomething()"}),
  sequence=(root)-[:INVOKES*]->(:Method)
RETURN
  nodes(sequence) as participants      // <1>
  relationships(sequence) as messages  // <2>
----
....
<1> The list of participants
<2> The list of messages exchanged between the participants

=== Configuration

The PlantUML Report plugin accepts several options that might be passed as report properties to jQAssistant:

[options="header"]
|===
| Property                   | Description                                                                                                                  | Default

| plantuml.report.rendermode | Specifies the renderer used for the generated PlantUML-Diagrams, currently supporting GraphViz (default), Smetana, and Elk   | GRAPHVIZ
